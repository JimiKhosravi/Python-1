## Task 1.2
## Recipe App
Create a structure that contains a set of attributes related to a specific recipe, and several of these “recipe structures” need to be stored sequentially in another outer structure.
## Recipe Structure
I am going to use a dictionary for the each recipe structure because I want to organize the name, cooking time and ingredients into key value pairs with their respective values. This will look more organized and display the most information about the recipe. 
I am going to put all of the recipe dictionaries into a list so that I can see every recipe displayed easily. I think a list is the best option for the recipes because it is easy to display, add and remove new recipes.
